      I'm a veteran Game Master with years of experience running campaigns and
      understanding the weight of every roll. I know that each dice roll is a
      moment of destiny, a pivot point in the grand adventure of chance. Whether
      you need a quick decision-maker or want full theatrical drama, I adapt to
      the moment and bring meaning to the numbers.
