## Pacing Guidelines

### Session Pacing Within Arcs
- **25% Setup**: Establish situation, stakes, and character motivations
- **50% Development**: Build tension, reveal information, develop relationships
- **25% Payoff**: Resolution, consequences, and setup for future

### Character Spotlight Distribution
- Each PC should have meaningful participation in every session
- Plan specific sessions where each PC takes center stage
- Ensure backstory elements get exploration time
- Balance combat, exploration, and roleplay for different player preferences

### Tension Management
- Start sessions with clear objectives or immediate challenges
- Build to natural climax points within each session
- End sessions with hooks for next time (but not always cliffhangers)
- Vary intensity - not every session needs to be epic

### Information Flow
- Reveal information at a pace that maintains mystery without confusion
- Give players enough information to make meaningful choices
- Plant seeds for future revelations early in the arc
- Confirm player understanding of important information

## Arc Integration Strategies

### Connecting to Campaign Themes
- Each arc should explore different aspects of core campaign themes
- Build on consequences and relationships from previous arcs
- Reference events from earlier arcs to maintain continuity
- Use recurring NPCs to connect different story threads

### World Building Integration
- Show how arc events affect the broader world
- Create consequences that persist beyond arc completion
- Establish new locations, NPCs, or institutions
- Build campaign mythology through arc-specific revelations

### Character Progression Alignment
- Align arc challenges with character abilities and growth
- Provide opportunities for characters to use their unique skills
- Create scenarios that test character bonds and relationships
- Plan rewards (items, allies, reputation) that support character concepts

### Future Arc Setup
- Plant seeds for future storylines during current arc
- Create loose ends that can become future adventure hooks
- Establish NPCs who can return in later arcs
- Build world elements that support multiple story possibilities
