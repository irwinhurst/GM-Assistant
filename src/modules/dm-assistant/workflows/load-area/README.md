# Load Area Workflow

This workflow guides the DM through loading, presenting, and managing area files during a session. It ensures that area descriptions, features, connections, and encounters are clearly presented and logged for real-time play.

## Purpose
- Load and present area files for exploration and gameplay
- Parse and display area descriptions, features, connections, and encounters
- Support interactive exploration and session logging

## Steps
1. **File Selection**
   - Scan data directory for area files (.md format)
   - Present list of available areas to DM
   - Allow quick search by area name or tags
2. **Area Processing**
   - Read selected area file
   - Parse area description, connections, and encounters
   - Identify interactive elements and special features
3. **Presentation Format**
   - Display area name, description, visible features, available actions, and DM-only information
   - Example format:
     ```markdown
     # Area Name
     **Description:** [Full area description]

     **Visible Features:**
     - [List obvious features players can see]
     - [Interactive elements they can examine]

     **Available Actions:**
     - Move to: [List connected areas with hyperlinks]
     - Investigate: [List searchable/interactive elements]
     - Combat: [List potential encounters if obvious]

     **Hidden/DM Only:**
     - [Secret features, hidden encounters, special rules]
     ```
4. **Session Logging**
   - Log area entry in session log
   - Note time and any special circumstances
   - Track player movement through adventure

## Quick Commands
- `next-area [name]` - Jump to connected area
- `search [feature]` - Investigate area feature
- `combat [encounter]` - Start specific encounter
- `rest` - Handle resting in current area

## Integration
- Compatible with session-runner and campaign-manager agents
- Works with area files generated by create-area and update-area workflows
- Supports session logging and navigation

## Best Practices
- Always present clear area descriptions and available actions
- Log all area entries and player movements for session records
- Use hyperlinks for easy navigation between areas
- Keep DM-only information separate for quick reference
