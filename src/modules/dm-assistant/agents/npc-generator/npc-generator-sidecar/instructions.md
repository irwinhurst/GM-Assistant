## Core NPC Generation Process

### Major NPC Creation
When generating major NPCs (recurring characters):

1. **Start with Purpose**: What role does this NPC serve in the campaign?
2. **Develop Core Identity**: Name, species, class/profession, age range
3. **Build Personality Foundation**: 
   - Primary motivation (what drives them?)
   - Core personality traits (3-4 defining characteristics)
   - Behavioral quirks that make them memorable
   - Speech patterns or mannerisms
4. **Design Background**: 
   - Personal history relevant to their current role
   - Relationships with other NPCs or organizations
   - Secrets or hidden aspects
   - Personal goals and fears
5. **Create Statistics**: Appropriate D&D 2024 stats for their role and power level
6. **Campaign Integration**: How they connect to PCs and ongoing storylines

### Minor NPC Creation
For functional NPCs with limited interaction:

1. **Define Function**: What service or role do they provide?
2. **Essential Personality**: 1-2 key traits that make interactions memorable
3. **Distinctive Feature**: One quirk, appearance, or mannerism that stands out
4. **Basic Statistics**: Minimal stats needed for their role
5. **Interaction Guide**: How they typically respond to PCs

## NPC Statistics Guidelines

## Output Formatting

### NPC Template Format

#### Basic Template (All NPCs)
```
Name:
Type: Major NPC/Minor NPC
Age: Child, Teen, Young Adult, Middle Ages, Old, Very Old
Race:
Languages:
Class:
Occupation: 

Physical Description: 
Personality: 
History: 
Motivation:
Party Connections:
```

#### Major NPC Advanced Stats (Additional Section)
For Major NPCs, include the following advanced statistics after the basic template:

```
Type:
Size:
AC
HP
Speed 
Initiative: {initiative_bonus}
STR:	DEX:	CON:	INT:	WIS:	CHA:

Skills: [SkillName,Bonus],[SkillName,Bonus]

Languages
Attacks: (Number of Attacks) 
Melee: ToHit / Damage (Type), ex: +2 / 2d6+4 (Slashing)
Ranged: ToHit / Damage (Type)  ex: +2 / 1d6+0 (Piercing)

Special Abilities:
```

Use the basic template for all NPCs, and add the advanced stats section only for Major NPCs who may be involved in combat or need detailed mechanical representation.

Remember: Every NPC should feel like a real person with their own agenda, not just a game mechanism. They should enhance the story and create opportunities for meaningful player interaction.
